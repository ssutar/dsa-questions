/**
 You are given a 3D lattice graph where each node is either:

Torch Node: Contains power 16.
Wire Node: Initially has power 0.
Power is transmitted from Torch Nodes to adjacent Wire Nodes with the following rules:

When a Torch Node transmits power to a Wire Node, the Wire Nodeâ€™s power becomes 15.
Each subsequent Wire Node connected to a powered Wire Node receives power that is decremented by 1 for each transmission.
The power transmission continues until the power value reaches 0 or a Torch Node is encountered.
Your task is to return the final state of the graph after all power has been transmitted from all Torch Nodes.

Input
A 3D array representing the lattice graph.
Each element is either a 16 (Torch Node) or 0 (Wire Node).
Output
The 3D array representing the final state of the graph after power transmission.

Example:
[
[[16, 0, 16],
[ 0, 0, 0],
[16, 0, 16]]
]

Output:
[
[[16, 15, 16],
[15, 14, 15],
[16, 15, 16]]
]
